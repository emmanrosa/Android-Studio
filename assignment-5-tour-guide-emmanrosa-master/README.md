# Tour Guide 
# Emmanuel Rosario 

For this assignment, you'll be making a Tour Guide app. This is an app with multiple screens, each of which lists a kind of attraction for a given city, national park, or historical monument. For instance, an app focused on Mountain View, CA might include a list of startup headquarters as well as a list of restaurants and a list of parks. Once you've decided on the location you'd like to show off, you'll want to build the structure of your app. Using the skills from the Miwok app, you'll make multiple screens, each containing a list. Next, you'll fill in those lists with list items, populated using a custom adapter. It may make sense for some lists to include information such as a phone number or business hours, but for others it may make more sense to have a photograph. Design your adapter based on the information you would like to show.
